Computerized Adaptive Tests tailor their difficulty to the skill level of the student taking the test. They are especially benefitial for students with low abilities, e.g. students with learning disabilities or intellectual disabilties. Diese Forschungsarbeiten entstanden im Rahmen des BMBF-Verbundprojekts "Digitale Adaptive Förderdiagnostik im Lesen" (DaF-L), das von August 2021 bis August 2024 lief.
