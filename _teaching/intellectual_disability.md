This project is dedicated to creating high-quality, accessible educational materials targeting students with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and learning disabilties. The aim is to provide meaningful support to educators by offering thoughtfully designed digital resources. They include a wide range of tools such as assessments for specific topics, instructional material and books in easy language. Each resource is designed with simplicity, clarity, and adaptability in mind, ensuring that it can be effectively used in a variety of educational settingsâ€”from mainstream classrooms to special education environments. All resources are offered free of charge and are available for immediate use in the classroom.
