Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio website! Here, I share an overview of my research projects and open educational resources. I am a German senior researcher in education sciences, focusing on special and inclusive education. My goal is to contribute to a more inclusive educational system through data-driven, empirical and simulation-based research on inclusive education systems and assessment practices. In my more practice-oriented projects, I develop and evaluate digital assessments and open educational resources for students with intellectual and learning disabilities.
